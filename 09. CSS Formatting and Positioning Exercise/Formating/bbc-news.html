                    One of Germany's most senior banking regulators has warned
                    London that it is likely to lose its role as "the gateway to
                    Europe" for vital financial services.
                    Dr Andreas Dombret, executive board member for the German
                    central bank, the Bundesbank, said that even if banking rules
                    were "equivalent" between the UK and the rest of the European
                    Union, that was "miles away from access to the single market".

                    One in five students in independent schools received extra
                    time to complete GCSE and A-level exams last year.
                    The proportion was significantly higher than those who
                    received the special measure in state schools where the
                    figure is fewer than one in eight.

                    The first comprehensive assessment of Europe's crickets
                    and grasshoppers has found that more than a quarter of
                    species are being driven to extinction.
                    According to the International Union for Conservation of
                    Nature (IUCN), the insect group is the most threatened of
                    those assessed so far in Europe.
